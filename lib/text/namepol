{C- {cRACES{x

You will need to choose a name which is appropriate for your character's
race. Below are some guidlines to help you.

{c- DWARVES{x

Dwarves believe they are fine, strong warriors, unmatched in combat. Their
names will represent this by having a strong, sharp sound.
{CExamples: Tumal, Naruk, Gandark.{x

{c- ELVES{x

As elves believe strongly in the powers of music, their names tend to be
soft, and almost song-like.
{CExamples: Velnarin, Myrethan, Lanthalin.{x

{c- GNOMES{x

Gnomes are odd creatures, and therefore have odd names. They are vibrant
and bouncy, and their names reflect this.
{CExamples: Lippble, Nufbby, Twypplb, Mulmble.{x

{c- HALFLINGS{x

Halflings are almost as odd as Gnomes, however their names can be even
sillier. Almost anything that is light and stupid will be acceptable
for a halfling.
{CExamples: Biffle, Moopal, Wolpah, Rathop{x

{c- HALF-ELVES{x

Being the offspring of humans and elves, half-elves can have either a
human or an elven name.
{CExamples: Valryn, Kealaria, Soavedna, Qupal.{x

{c- HUMANS{x

Humans have the widest variety of names, however they very rarely possess
the sharpness or tone of, for example, a troll or ogre.
{CExamples: Valsar, Morvul, Taloran, Telseen, Luthar.{x

{c- TROLLS{x

Trolls are horrible creatures, of particularly low intelligence. Their
names are short, badly spelt and often use odd combinations of many of
the unused letters of the alphabet, eg. z,k,g.
{CExamples: Voraak, Blzrog, Gorakk, Arkkz{x

{c- OGRES{x

Large, hulking beasts, Ogres are far dumber than trolls and have similar
names. Harsh, but not sharp gutteral sounds, with an emphasis on phlegm.
{CExamples: Bolag, Falrag, Moggo, Gluog.{x

{cDo TRY to choose a medieval type of name.  If you have any questions{x
{cregarding the acceptability of a certain name, feel free to ask a God{x
{cfor input and guidance.{x
