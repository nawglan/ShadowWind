Neera    (Aug  7) [ 3084] Hrm, I'd venture to say that the crash at 9:40 am was my fault.  Was casting incendiary cloud on 3 wraiths and Morticia (in stone dragon) one died by fireshield (he was target of the spell).
Vorik    (Aug  7) [ 3743] if I try to cast a spell like "shocking grasp" on a creature which is not there, it says "Your spell's target is nolonger here." and not the other message like "cast on who?!"

Sibbie   (Aug 11) [ 3770] raise and eye do the same emote...should have raise, raise hand.
Thudnuffle (Aug 11) [ 3088] Sleep spell is aggro even when successful. Cast it on an apprentice in the guild, he fell asleep, and then he attacked me... How can he do that if asleep?
Vorik    (Aug 11) [10271] identifying the flame blade gives wierd results
Vorik    (Aug 11) [ 5194] cure serious heals the same amount as cure critical?

Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] I"m confused.. I add in some ideas and they seem to bomb.  =(
Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] nevermind, figured it out.
Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] it is possible to teleport to caryllion from the wiervane side of the docks simply by waiting for the ferry to be on the caryllion side, while you are in WV, and using "board ferry" when there isn't a visible ferry.  You appear on the ferry docked in caryllion, and then you can disembark and be in caryllion without the wait.
Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] a specific time to check it out is at 6am on the WV side.  It is untested in its reverse.
Vorik    (Aug 14) [14552] Although it's nice that I can't fumble it, I still can't get rid of my flamesword by camping and coming back in like 4 hours RT or dispel magic it.
Hawthos  (Aug 14) [ 3017] When I backstab with my venomous drow sword I usually get the following message:The insert mob name makes a strange sound as you place NULL in his back.  The mob name, I put there. The NULL is what I get.  Let me know If I have caused confusion.
Zlark    (Aug 15) [ 3150] I formerly attacked an apprencice cleric, using an elemental as a tank, and it ended up being dead and bleeding.. i couldn't kill it so I left it there, and after a repop it was still there, with two other apprentices.. I cast "earthquake", which ignored the dying one.. I could only kill it after bandaging it..
Thudnuffle (Aug 15) [ 3701] Ferry masters can see invis ppl good enuff to take gold from them, but not good enuff to let them pass...

Zlark    (Aug 17) [ 4002] if i give an item of +max_hps to an elemental, and it wears it, and then heals up, then removes it.. it keeps the additional hitpoints.
Zlark    (Aug 17) [ 3081] the spell 'control weather' ends up pausing at the end, and is not abortable.
Dorga    (Aug 18) [ 1295] dagger to mental, order mental to circle, over and over fast as you want.
Dorga    (Aug 18) [ 1295] Mentals useing weapons and armor, there created as a weapon and as armor themsleves, why give more?

Zlark    (Aug 23) [ 3086] I was KOed by a guard, and when I awoke, and did a "look", I saw that my fire elemental was still fighting, even though I was getting no text updating the fight..  it was "frozen".

Zlark    (Sep  1) [ 5197] the previously mentioned bug happens when I am alone as well.  Enemies can attack after being incapacitated and dying.

Neera    (Sep 10) [ 3148] Something in both the Sneak skill and the Hide skill allow all classes to use it AND to improve at it...  by spamming 'sneak' for a minute or so, my sneak skill improved up to above average.  Of course, I like the skill, but I'm afraid I shouldn't have it :(

Zlark    (Sep 18) [ 3081] things which are knocked unconscious with negative HPs should still be engaged in combat and should be considered auto-kills the next round in combat.. they shouldn't bleed to death and take away the person's xp gain.

Zlark    (Sep 27) [ 3727] in caryllion, rodrin, for example will "hit" me when I have stoneskin, but do no damage (as per normal), as opposed to "missing".. this is only in caryllion with the dignified or rodrin (so far), and doesn't happen elsewhere, in Wiervane for example..
