Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] don't allow magicstabbing - make invisible things become "vis" at the start of casting.  After all,;they are mumbling magical words and whatnot, which makes their position known.  In the same;strain, perhaps some aggressive spells to some creatures should make the creature attack at the;beginning of casting if it knows it's an aggressive spell (like a mage / priest).
Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] make lesser creation spells for weapons for wizards for their off hand?

Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] remove the ability to flee multiple times in quick succession.  This saves lives in the sense that sometimes I try to flee manually, and my autoflee kicks in before my manual flee does, and then I end up fleeing back into the room I autofled from, which kills me.
Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] be able to deposit into another person's account and/or attach money to mail for a person.

Kar      (Aug 14) [ 3081] make occaisional room saves for places like the donations well (garden of restoration).  People have a fear of donating because of the crashes wiping out the well.  Perhaps make all healing areas like that?  -- (Sorry if I've mentioned this before already.. I might have.)
Karkazz  (Aug 14) [ 3534] Not that I'd like to see any, but if there are places where the healing rate is doubled, shouldn't there also be places where it is halved?
Vorik    (Aug 14) [10271] have the flameblade illuminate
Sibbie   (Aug 14) [ 3775] rogue type classes get exp for pick lock and steal..and rogue stuff...because they arn't good solo fighters..but always picking locks for peole..

Karkazz  (Aug 15) [ 3686] "word of recall" scrolls.  Even hideously expensive ones.
Karkazz  (Aug 15) [ 3002] Perhaps a prog could be added to wandering merchants so if the see "R.I.P

Zlark    (Aug 16) [ 5191] allow people to speciailize in a specific type of creature/elemental to conjure to give them a greater chance of summoning that one, or perhaps give them a different spell to only conjure that one.
Zlark    (Aug 17) [10287] have elementals report when enchantments have worn off.
Bugglewump (Aug 17) [ 5707] At least one more conjuring spell, possibly demon summoning?
Bugglewump (Aug 17) [ 5700] also, perhaps "conjure para-elemental" (lava, smoke, steam, rain, mud, dust)
