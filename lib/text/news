{W/ {c Made a few miscellaneous changes to the worlds tonight. No I will not
   go into further detail, suffice to say we live in an everchanging world
   and something you were sure of yesterday, may have changed today. In
   other words, be careful - you have been warned.

{W**** {Y09{W-{Y26{W-{Y98 {W*
{W! {c Circan's personal crash bug is gone. Just so you know where we're
   at in terms of stability, the last umpteen crashes were from that bug.
   So, AS FAR AS I KNOW, there are no current crash bugs, or if there are,
   this last one was crashing us before they had a chance to show
   themselves.
{W! {c Dodge has been improved a bit, but it may not be permanent
   depending on how things work out. So no complaints if it gets toned
   down again :)

{W**** {Y09{W-{Y23{W-{Y98 {W*
{W! {c Be sure you know the policy, as the rules are there for a reason.
   If you do not understand, then ask, but ask US, not the other players. 
   The only way to know for sure is to ask those who created the rules. 
   Otherwise, it can, and most likely will bite you in the ass. Using your
   characters to help your other characters is definitely aginst the    
   rules. Also, as this may be unclear as well, if you are part of a
   group, and one of your other characters would be beneficial to that
   group and you logoff, bring the other character on to use there
   beneficial skills or spells, then log back off and return to the group
   with your original character, it is unacceptable. This is happening all
   too often, and is definitely now, and always has been aginst the rules.
 
{W- {c Vamp is removed as of now.

{W**** {Y09{W-{Y22{W-{Y98 {W*

{W! {cPlayer Killing has been updated in our policy to include the
   continued abuse of spells being cast upon mobs in order to harm
   and or kill another player, we have asked that this stop, but as
   of this time it has not, so. be warned, with out any further 
   warning whatsoever, if you are part of the cause your character 
   will be deleted, if you login and complain about it with another
   charcater, well.. just think before you speak. ;)

   {cConsider this your last, and I do stress, {CFinal {cwarning on this
   matter.

{W**** {Y09{W-{Y14{W-{Y98 {W*
{W+ {cAdded info in HELP MAILING LIST about the new Admin/Player list

{W**** {Y09{W-{Y07{W-{Y98 {W*
{W! {c Today somehow the system tossed up a lung, and approx 24 hours
   worth of game play is missing, files from those who were online were
   a wonderful 0 bytes in size so.. a backup was placed in, the backup
   was 24 hours old. Sorry for the problems, and yes, everyone that 
   played durring this time lost something, some more than others, we 
   are sorry but there will be no reimbs.. :P Please understand.

   Also, because of this we have adopted a new update procidure,
   every hour on the hour we backup the player data and object files
   each in there own format to prevent the (hopefully) possability of
   ever loosing both objects and data again.

{W/ {c Finally fixed the bug with long ideas or bug reports... If you crash
   the mud now using either of these commands, you will be drawn, quartered,
   and left with 0 moves in the Castle.
{W! {c Cityguards will now knock you out (most of the time).  Also, the elite
   gateguard is harder to kill so be careful.

{W/ {c Fixed some bugs in stats/att.
{W/ {c Increased amount you can type when providing an idea or bug report.
{W! {c Enchanted objects can only be enchanted once.  If you have an object
   that has been enchanted to provide exceptional AC, I would strongly
   suggest that you lose it now.  Exploiting a bug is not recommended.

{W/ {c Fixed some problems with isname (order fire, etc).
