     The citizens watched in fear, the Gods were at war.  The skies were
streaked with flame and the resultant rain struck heavily on the streets of 
Garathorm. The people knew little of the Gods quarreling, and there dreams
were plagued with thoughts of what would happen to them.  The people, 
massed together in hopes of surviving the nightmares of the Gods creations.

     The fires raged in the heavans and the clouds hung low over garathorm.
The people of Garathorm came out of there homes, wondering about the sudden
calm.  They looked over the horizon and saw the reason the gods had stopped
there quarreling.  A great darkness encompassed the sky to the south.  It
became a great threat to all of Garathorm and even to the Gods themselves.

     The "ShadowWind", as they called it, approached quickly, and devoured 
everything it touched.  Even the gods could not protect themselves from the
darkness. When it was over, those that we're left cried to the heavens for 
protection. The prayers went unanswered, as the Gods, those that were left,
were too weak to reply.  What power they had, they had to use to rebuild.  
Those that were left, man and God, restored what they could, and made new 
what they could not, in the Age of the ShadowWind.
