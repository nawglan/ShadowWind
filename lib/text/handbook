{CNow here are some guidelines to help your on your journey as an Immortal.


{CAs an Immortal here at ShadowWind you are expected to act in accordance
with the guidelines set forth by the administration.  Disciplinary action
is not something that should have to be exercised with Immortals.  
Therefore, if it is needed, rest assured that it will be swift and harsh.{x


{CThe administration itself consists of those listed on the wizlist.{x

{CIn the event of ANY problem that may occur, bug, error, whatever.
The highest level Immortal online at the time has the final say in
how it is handled.  They are expected to find a fix for the problem
within the scope of their power.  This decision, can and may, be 
changed by another higher level Immortal at a later time.  The main
idea here is to keep the MUD running.  There will be no arguments
with higher level Immortals tolerated.  They are a higher level for
a reason and what they say goes.{x
