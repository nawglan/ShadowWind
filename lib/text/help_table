{c- ALIGNMENT{x

Your ALIGNMENT is a measure of how good or evil your character is.
At Shadowwind, you choose your alignment during the creation of
your character. For reasons of logic, not all races can choose any
alignment, i.e. trolls and ogres cannot be good aligned.

Alignments have been specifically designed to be very difficult to
change, so choose carefully.

Some mobs will react differently to different alignments, as will
some equipment.

The threasholds for alignment ranges are:

 +1000  -  +350      Good Aligned
  +349  -  -349      Neutrally Aligned
  -350  -  -1000     Evil Alignment

You can see your alignment using the STAT command.

WIZLIST will show you the members of the Administration of Shadowwind.
These people have ultimate control over the mud and what happens within
it. There will be no arguing with them, however please feel free to make
suggestions and constructive criticism.

They understand the mud very well, and should you have any problems,
these are the people to ask. That being said, please do not ask ANY
immortal to help you with game play (e.g corpse retrieval, tips on an
area, directions).

If you wish to communicate to the administration at any time, please
use the PETITION channel online, or alternativly, feel free to email
any questions, comments or suggestions to the mailing list. See HELP
MAILING LIST for the address.

Those under the BUILDERS heading in the wizlist, are the people you
should thank for helping create the world in which you play. They
write new areas, fix old ones, and contribute in many other ways.

IMMLIST shows the retired Immortals from Shadowwind, people who have
contributed in the past, but for many reasons, have chosen to
move on.

Saving throws are a chance that a spell will have no effect on your
victim (or you if you are the victim). Saving throws can be decreased
by equipment. (The lower the value, the higher your chance of a spell
failing if cast upon you).

Your saving throw information can be seen in STAT.

@~

{c- SPELLS{x

A word of warning - casting classes on Shadowwind have been specifically
designed to be difficult to play. Please do not complain when you are
having a hard time leveling.

To see a list of your spells, type: SPELLS

Spells are assigned to classes in what are called "circles". Every class
has circles assigned to the same level, but not all spells are assigned
at the same circle, for different classes. For example, one class may
get "fireball" at circle 2, while another will get it at circle 4.

A spells' damage will not stay the same as you advance in level. The
higher your level, the more damage a spell will do. For example, "magic
missile" (circle 1) may do 5-20 points damage when you first get it
(level 1), but at level 50 it may do 30-50 point damage. (Note these
numbers are for example purposes and are not to be taken literally.)

Mana usage also decreases with increasing level.

Circles are given at the following levels:

Circle  1 = {clevel 1                   {wCircle  7 = {clevel 31{x
Circle  2 = {clevel 6                   {wCircle  8 = {clevel 35{x
Circle  3 = {clevel 11                  {wCircle  9 = {clevel 41{x
Circle  4 = {clevel 16                  {wCircle 10 = {clevel 46{x
Circle  5 = {clevel 21                  {wCircle 11 = {clevel 50{x
Circle  6 = {clevel 26{x

The syntax for casting spells is: {ccast 'spellname' <target>
                      {wExample #2: {ccast 'fireball' troll
                      {wExample #3: {ccast 'heal' me (or your name)
                      {wExample #4: {ccast 'earthquake'{x

As it stands now, you will have to practice each spell once when you
advance to a new circle (to learn that spell from your guildmaster).
After that, your success is partially dependant on your skill in the
realm of magic to which that spell has been assigned. ie. summoning
realm, creation realm, elemental realm, etc.

Other factors that can influence your success, are mentioned below.

{cYou lost your concentration! {w- This is probably the most annoying, but
                               you will only ever lose concentration on
                               your current, and previous circle.

{cYou fail miserably!          {w- Because of lack of skill, you failed to
                               cast this spell.

{cNothing seems to happen!     {w- Your target had a successful saving throw,
                               i.e. they were successful in avoiding
                               your spell. This message is also used when
                               spell resistances kick in.

{cYour spells target is no     {w- Exactly that, you (or your target) moved
{clonger here.                   {wbefore you could complete casting.

You will notice spell casting times - these are dependant on your level,
proficiency in the spell and for priest classes, your wisdom; for mage
classes, your intelligence will be a factor.

Essentially, spell realms represent your skill in spell casting.

Each spell is assigned to a particular realm of magic. Creation,
Divination, Elemental, Enchantment, General, Healing, Protection or
Summoning.

Once you have learned a new spell from your guildmaster, your success
in casting the spell will be partially dependant on your skill in the
realm of magic to which that spell has been assigned.

Trolls are a nasty, dumb, evil, ugly digusting species that are feared
by all other races. A troll is easy to identify, as their thick greenish
skin, beady black eyes, and matted, rotten, stringy black hair gives
them quite a horrifying appearance. Trolls tend to hunt together in
clans, and spend a large amount of time terrorising the homes of other
races. Great strength and a great lack of intelligence are distinguishing
features of most trolls, and they tend to regenerate from battle wounds
at a remarkably fast rate.

sparsly forested areas, and possess remarkable intelligence and agility.
Their small stature makes them weaker and less durable than humans, but
their sharp wits and great stealth can easily make up for this.

Dwarves are a clumsy race, they are short, yet sturdy and make fearsome
warriors with high endurance. Dwarves prefer to live in mountain
ranges rather than large cities, and often build fortresses into the
mountainside. Although their physical appearance may not make it obvious,
dwarves can gain great wisdom over their long lifetimes Often sharing
their knowledge with other good natured races, Dwarves have become one
of the most respected races, both for their superb craftsmanship, and
friendly nature.

natured and kind hearted race, despite having a habit of lifting other
people's posessions. Where Halflings are lacking in in intelligence and
wisdom,  they make up for in their dexterity and shining character.

So you want to build an area, first speak with an admin, let them know
what type of area you wish to build, if noone is online to help you, see
HELP MAILING for a email address you can send your idea to. After your
area idea is accepted then you need to ftp to the site below and get the
documentation.

ftp.ionet.net/pub/users/seeker/creation.doc

Login: anonymous
Password: youremail@yoursite

At this point, build your area, use zone 999 for your building, we will
change the 999 to what we need once your done. Dont expect to build
the area perfect the first time, there will be errors, we will let you
know what they are and show you how to fix them. After all problems
are corrected the area will be placed online for testing, at which time
you will be granted an immortal. We will then balance the mobs, and
objects within the area. As soon as balancing is completed, and the admin
feel the area is ready for playing it will be placed within the world, you
will of course be able to request where it will be placed, but if the
request is not "proper" in the grand scheme of things, we will tell you
why and find a suitable place for it.

Now, on to the ownership thing.

with the intention of those areas being placed in and run under the code
created for Shadowwind Mud are owned explicitly by Shadowwind Mud and
controlled by the Administration of Shadowwind Mud.  Those areas listable
in full context with the immortal command 'show zones' are completely
upgradable/downgradable, removable and configurable by the Administration
of Shadowwind Mud to allow for control of balance within the game.

If you are a current builder, or wish to be a builder, and do not agree
to relinquish the rights to the areas you create then you do hold the
right to not build for Shadowwind Mud.  If you do however agree to
relinquish your rights as 'owner' of the area you create for Shadowwind
Mud, then your area will be welcomed providing it does fit the theme
and context of the game.

These same rules apply to any, and all other work done for or to
Shadowwind Mud, including, but not limited to, Code, Ideas, Web Pages.

Any work provided to Shadowwind Mud will not be removed from Shadowwind
Mud if you choose to, or are asked to depart from Shadowwind Mud.

It would be greatly appreciated if any area you make for Shadowwind
Mud was seen only on this world, this being very hard to control all
we may do to enforce this is trust you to your honor and word.

If you wish to build for Shadowwind, or have comments or questions,
please email: swadmin@shadowwind.org

{wWhen you have finished your days travelling and wish to leave the realm
for a time, you do not have to make the often long and arduous trek back
to a city to rent. You may CAMP in any location in the realm, as long as
it is not in a city.

Camp is not an instant command, as it takes time to prepare you campsite.
If you leave the room while you are preparing to camp, you will need to
re-camp.

Next time you enter the game, you will appear in the same room you camped
in.

{wCONSENT allows you to give your permission to another player to remove

{c- PCORPSE{x

When you die, you re-enter the game at your guild. You can retrieve your
corpse by traveling to your place of death and getting the items from
inside. Your corpse will remain intact for approximatly 2 real-time
hours, regardless of whether the character is online.

To get objects from a player corpse:

> get <items> pcorpse
> get <items> <player name>
> get all pcorpse

Each time you die you lose a percentage of experience for your level. It
is wise to be careful to avoid death when you have recently gained a
level. If the experience lost due to death is more than you have gained in
your current level, you will "lose a level".

You cannot remove items from another oplayer's corpse unless they have
given you their CONSENT.

AC is your armor class.  It is a number from -100 to 100, roughly
defined as follows:

  100   Naked person

@ALIASES
@~

{c- ALIAS{x

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overriden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb

A semicolon (;) can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the TOGGLE command to set the level of coloring you see.

> toggle color off
This command disables all color.

> toggle color sparse
> toggle color normal
> toggle color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

you, i.e "his many scars make it obvious he is an accomplished warrior" is

you will be at your guild.

The TIME command will show you how long it has been since the last
CRASH or REBOOT.

If you type a command or do something strange just prior to a crash,
or notice any patterns to crashes, please notify the administration

A reboot should only take about 1 minute.

The TIME command will show you how long it has been since the last
CRASH or REBOOT.

Sometimes, the MUD will need to be shutdown for a short period of
time. This is to allow for maintenance of the machine, and major code
/area changes. You will not be able to connect to Shadowwind while
the MUD is shutdown. We try to keep these times to a minimum, but

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points.

The amount of experience points gained from a kill, is not visible. If
you wish to see how your progress is to your next level, simply type:
EXP at the prompt. This will give you a rough indication of your progress.

Each time you die you lose a percentage of experience for your level. It

Ahh, they say money doesn't make the world go round, but it sure makes
things a lot easier. There are a few ways to increase the size of your
purse. As only some mobs carry a few coins, the easiest and most
successful means is to sell any excess objects you may find. There are
many shops in the cities, and some in more obscure locations. You'll
find most shopkeepers drive a hard bargain, however, its better than
nothing.

It is not always a good idea to carry your entire wealth with you.
Who knows what dastardly thief may be lurking round the next corner,
or when you will need to buy a torch to recover your badly beaten corpse.
Depositing your coins in a bank is a safe way to store it.

@GROUP
@~

{c- GROUP{x

{cUsage : group <player>
        group all{x

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
group all groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a leader must be selected. All members of the group
must then follow the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using group <player_name>. The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : follow dragon
Redferne: follow dragon
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : group dragon
Dragon  : group redferne
Dragon  : group quifael

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : Group Quifael to kick Quifael out of the group.

Inns are places where the weary traveller may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure. At this time, rent is free.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
As it stand now, rent is free, however you will need to rent at an inn,
quitting will result in all your equipment dropping to the ground.

If you lose link, you will be force rented after a period of time, while
you are linkdead however, you are not safe from aggressive mobs, and
death. You will not be reimbursed for equipment lost in a linkdead
death, so it is wise to attempt to reconnect and rent. Your unstable
link is not the fault of the MUD, if your network looks shaky, don't
risk your character - don't login.

{cIn an effort to promote a medieval, fantasy atmosphere throughout
Shadowwind, a name policy regarding character creation has been
established. Under this policy, the following guidelines must be
adhered to when choosing a new name:{x

{c[{w1{c] {wNo obscene, insulting, threatening or degrading names will
    {wbe tolerated.{x

{c[{w2{c] {wNo modern trademarks, cartoon characters, product names,
    {wetc. are allowed.{x

{c[{w3{c] {wNo incoherent collection of random letters is allowed.{x

{c[{w4{c] {wNo names that imply rank or privilage.{x
    {wFor example: King, Lady{x

{c[{w5{c] {wNo names implying any religious reference or preference.{x
    {wFor example: God, Buddha{x

{c[{w6{c] {wNo names refering to historical figures, living or dead.{x

    {wFor example: Merlin, Aragorn{x

{c[{w8{c] {wNo everyday names or everyday words.{x
     {wFor example: Mike, Sarah, Pickle

{C- {cRACES{x

You will need to choose a name which is appropriate for your character's
race. Below are some guidlines to help you.

{c- DWARF{x

Dwarves believe they are fine, strong warriors, unmatched in combat.
Their names will represent this by having a strong, sharp sound.
{CExamples: Tumal, Naruk, Gandark.{x

{c- ELVES{x

As elves believe strongly in the powers of music, their names tend to be
soft, and and almost song-like.
{CExamples: Velnarin, Myrethan, Lanthalin.{x

{c- GNOMES{x

Gnomes are odd creatures, and therefore have odd names. They are vibrant
and bouncy, and their names reflect this.
{CExamples: Lippble, Nufbby, Twypplb, Mulmble.{x

{c- HALFLINGS{x

Halflings are almost as odd as Gnomes, however their names can be even
sillier. Almost anythings that is light and stupid will be acceptable
for a halfling.
{CExamples: Biffle, Moopal, Wolpah, Rathop{x

{c- HALF-ELVES{x

Being the offpring of humans and elves, half-elves can have either a
human or an elven name.
{CExamples: Valryn, Kealaria, Soavedna, Qupal.

{c- HUMANS{x

Humans have the widest variety of names, however they very rarely possess
the sharpness or tone of, for example, a troll or ogre.
{CExapmples: Valsar, Morvul, Taloran, Telseen, Luthar.{x

{c- TROLLS{x

Trolls are horrible creatures, of particularly low intelligence. Their
names are short, badly spelt and often use odd combinations of many of
the unused letters of the alphabet, eg. z,k,g.
{CExamples: Voraak, Blzrog, Gorakk, Arkkz{x

{c- OGRE{x

Large, hulking beasts, Ogres are far dumber than trolls and have similar
names. Harsh, but not sharp gutteral sounds, with an emphasis on phlegm.
{CExamples: Bolag, Falrag, Moggo, Gluog.{x

{cDo TRY to choose a medieval type of name.  If you have any questions
regarding the acceptability of a certain name, feel free to ask a God
for input and guidance.{x

@LINK DEAD
@LINKDEAD
@LD
@~

{c- LINK{x

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

@MP
@~

{c- MULTIPLAYING{x

Multiplaying is defined by the playing of more than one character at any
time by any one person, or the sharing of any character by two people.


       a)  You MAY NOT have more than one character in the game at
           any one time. THIS INCLUDES LINKDEAD CHARACTERS. You must rent
           out your second and any subsequent characters before you
           bring on a new one.

           If you are caught, your corpse, complete with eq, will be
           purged.

      The only exception to this rule is stated below.

      b)    The only time that you can have more than one character in
            the game is for the purpose of exchanging equipment
            or gold between your characters. You MUST keep ALL of your
            characters at the Reception at ALL TIMES. None of your
            characters may leave this room.

            There are no exceptions to this rule.

      c)    You MAY NOT bring on another character to retrieve your
            corpse if you die. This includes renting, and bringing on
            another character to relocate, summon, enchant or locate
            objects in your corpse.

      d)    You may not briefly log out one character, only to log on
            another to assist your character or your group. This
            includes picking locks, locating objects, summoning and
            relocation. Your characters should be played as if they
            have no connection to each other.

      e)    You MAY NOT cast any spells of any nature on another of
            your characters. The Reception is a !magic room for a
            reason. This does not mean you can quickly move rooms to
            cast a spell because you couldn't in Reception.

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to
your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve. Your maximum proficiency
in a skill is set for you, dependant on your level. When you gain a level,
the amount you can learn a particular skill, increases. We do not use the
"practice sessions" system on Shadowwind, however, the more you use a
skill, the more proficient you will become in it.

Example: prac 1h bludgeon  -or-  prac 1h b

The Pray/Petition channels are the only way in which you should seek
to communicate with the Administration of Shadowwind.  If you have a
problem while you are online, use these channels only, do not use
the other communication channels, they were created for other functions.

The channels Petition and Pray show to all immortals that are online,
it does not show to any other mortals playing the game, and any responce
given to you via these channels is also seen only by you, and all of
the immortals online.  If you do not get an answer from anyone,
mostlikely there are no immortals online, or, they are busy doing
something else. =)

Note: Both PRAY and PETITION are the same channel, for the same
purpose. We implemented PETITION as an alternative for those players
who have personal reasons for not wanting to use PRAY in this manner.

@SAVE

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings, or camp in a
safe place outside of a town

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are often rugged, capable people, roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is
death in the end.

{- ATTRIBUTES{x

Your character's stats help determine how healthy you are, how much
you can learn, how well you fight and how well you can avoid being hit
in a fight. Obviously the higher the stat, the better. Each race and
class has advantages in some stats and disadvantages in others. This
is why some races are limited in choices of professions.

Stats are randomly rolled when your character is created. Stats can
be increased or decreased through the use of certain objects and
spells. Discovering which objects and spells are helpful and which
are harmful is part of the game and will not be discussed here.

You will not see your stats in numbers for some time. With increasing
level, you will be able to see your character attributes more clearly.

Without going into coding details this is a brief rundown of what each
stat effects:

{CSTR (strength)     : {w STR effects your attack speed (how fast you
                     attack in a fight), the amount of objects you can
                     carry and your hitroll.

{CCON (Constitution) : {w CON effects the number of hitpoints you gain each
                     time you level.

{CWIS (Wisdom)       : {w WIS is important for CLERIC type classes, and will
                     affect your casting times and success at casting.

{CINT (Intelligence) : {w INT is important for MAGE type classes, and will
                     affect your casting times and success at casting.

{CDEX (Dexterity)    : {wDEX effects your defensive ability.  A higher DEX
                     makes it harder for a mob to hit you in a fight.

{CAGI (Agility)      : {w Affects your natural ARMOR CLASS. A higher AGI means
                     a better AC.

@TIME

{c- TIME{x

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
TIME also displays when the game was booted and calculates how long ago
that was.

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command can be used to change these values, and toggle values off and
on. All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. they
are saved when you quit or rent.

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, execpt yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Danny Baker, for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Brett Turner, for managing the CircleMUD Mailing List.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- And, of course, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
