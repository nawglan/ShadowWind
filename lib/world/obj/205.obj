flaming stone~
The small stone easily fits into the palm of your hands. It is cool to the
touch, but burns with a flaming red aura. As you look at it, you cant help
but think how beautiful it is, and become slightly mesmerised. It would
greatly increase your stature to show this off to your friends.

the numbers 666 branded on the sides are a little ominous.

mask serpent~
Many small serpents must have died to make this mask. Their small tails have
been cut off and left to dry. Some kind of black thread has been used to 
stitch them all together to make this mask. The two small eye-holes have a
thin crystal sliver in them, the purpose of which is unknown.

The tiny golden stud is no bigger than the iris of your eye. Round in shape,
and made from pure gold, it is very malleable and wont stand too much wear 
and tear. Perhaps magic could be used to strengthen it up a little. It could
certainly be sold for a great sum of money to the right buyer.

fiery whip~
A short leather handle allows you to pick the whip up safely. The rest of the
six feet length of the whip burns in a fiery embrace. Some kind of magic must
stop the leather handle from being consumed, and it is this same magic that
protects you from the searing heat. Most of the damage the whip does is from
the intense heat it produces as it strikes the target, rather than any kind 
of brutal force.

metal collars that extend down over the ears and cheekbones towards your 
chin. Made from copper, the helm is reddish in colour and pitted with 
dimples. Two large horns protrude out of the top, curling up at least six 
inches. These horns could do lethal damage during hand to hand combat.

blood. Through the peeling paint-work, rust has started to bubble through, 
giving it an ugly appearance. The outlines of a large, horned being have been 
stencilled on the outside surface in what looks like black tar.

The small ring burns with the ferocity of fire. Some unknown magic allows
you to hold it without being burnt in the least, a small prickling the only
sensation you can feel. The colours continually change from red to orange to
yellow, with a multitude of colours inbetween. It would be good protection
against somebody in a battle.

pleasing to the touch. The outside has several scenes of humans, orcs, elves
and dwarves all in battle. Above them, looking down, is a horned being, a
terrible grin on his face. The goblet seems to be able to hold an 
extraordinary volume of liquid, quite in excess of its apparent size.

The ring looks very large, intended for a big person. It is very unlikely
that it will fit you well, and for some reason, you get the feeling you
shouldn't even try to wear it. The red crystal sparkles with what can only
be an evil light. An evil emanation comes from deep inside it.

These are the horns of Satan Himself, cleaved from the top of his head at
the moment of his destruction. They are magnificent looking, each ten inches
long and pristine white in colour. Used in battle, they could cause severe
damage to an opponent. They give you a sense of power and rejuvenated
strength.

These are the claws of Satan Himself, severed from his feet at the moment of
his final annihilation. These claws are really impressive to look at. They
both curl to fifteen inches long, razor sharp along their whole length, and
ending in a wicked point. They would do serious damage if used in a fight.

As Satan was eradicated from the face of the Earth, his evil spirit fled his
mortal body to regain strength and rework his evil over the next millennia.
Little was left of the mortal body, but this great piece of bone from his
chest survived almost intact. It is still incredibly hard and seemingly
impermeable. Just touching it gives you the feeling of total power and
supremacy, the illusion its creator suffered also.
