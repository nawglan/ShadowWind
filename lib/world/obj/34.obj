acorn small~
Small and hard this acorn would make the perfect meal for a chipmunk but for
a human it seems doubtful. You consider what attracts chipmunks to them in the
first place as it does not appear to be very satisfying.

axe wooden~
An instrument of destruction as well as a tool to cut firewood, this axe is
dangerous. With a long heavy wooden handle, and a gleaming blade of solid
steel, the size of this axe indicates that a big, strong person was meant to
handle it.

This sturdy rivercraft that you see before you is simple in design and free
of any extraneous frills or decorations. Built for speed and agility in the
sometimes rough conditions of the river, her body is such that she would
easily dance over the waves that any wind could whip up. Any passenger, 
though not impressed by her lack of polish and lustre, would feel safe
travelling on this vessel.
