holy vambraces weaved stone~
  You examine some vambraces weaved of stone more closely to find great detail.
Within the weaves, there seems to be human flesh and blood, hundreds of years
old. The stone and weaves react to your touch with strange patters, slowly
changing shape and molding to fit your touch perfectly with divine power.

diamond wood greaves~
   You closely examine some Diamond Wodd vambraces and find some quite
extraordinary details. The Diamonds are apparently what the wood was
carved with. It appears some strange mystical power made them one with
the wood. They begin to form words in the wood, and tell a story. The
story goes on about the Haven os Stones and its followers. It tells tales
of old battles and a rising of a great cleric by the name of "Jostoricath."
Wherein these stories tell of Jostircath rising from a revolution inside the
stones and imprisoning the high clerics. It finishes all the stories that
Jostoricath has deafeated the realm, and hiding it from the outside world.
