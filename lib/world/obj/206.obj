protective helm~
The helm is made from steel, over one inch thick. It has been painted a 
bright yellow colour which really makes the wearer stand out amongst the 
crowd. It should protect you well from small stones and falling debris, but
it could be quite dangerous to wear if something really heavy fell upon you.
It would make good battle protection.
