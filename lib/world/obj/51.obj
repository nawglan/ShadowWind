It is complete my'lady, the adventurers have taken all four of the vile
mother's head's, and shall free you from the reigns of this wretched place,
I beg thee, flee this dredded city as soon as they finish off the Yochlol
the spells that have been cast upon you are reversable and you can once
again lead all good elf to glory.

Your humble mage for all eternity,

        Vincer the Grand.
