statue autumn~
   This statue resembles a fairly comely woman. Carefully carved from a
single piece of ivory, this is truly a work of art. Long hair cascades down
her back, partially covering a large leaf motif on her back. This leaf, and
two smaller ones on each of her shoulders, are colored crimson. She appears
to be dressed in light leather armor and carries a shortsword at her hip. 
There is an inscription at it's base.
