Bottom Of The Mine Shaft~
   You find yourself in the very heart of Moria. The tunnels are very
narrow, but carved from the strongest of bedrock. You hear the constant
drip.. drip.. of water all around you. A loud scream suddenly pierces
the air, sending an involuntary shiver through you.
There is a stone sign here.

be a mixture of decaying flesh and sulphurous gases. Strewn around the floor
are bones of all kinds, some with a little flesh still on, half-chewed by a
beast of some kind. The tunnel continues to the east. There is a small hole
in the far corner with a ladder leading downwards.

The Turbulent Cavern~
   Braving to enter this place, you find it almost impossible to stand in
one position for more than a few seconds. The wind roars down from a hole
in the roof far above you, and screams off along a tunnel to the west, 
trying to find an escape route. Although you can see tunnels to the north
and east, its impossible to fight against the wind. The only exit is to
fly with the wind to the west.

Looking up was not too good an idea. A huge blast of wind almost blinds

Big drops of a black and viscous liquid slowly ooze out of the roof and drip
to the ground. As they hit the floor, a loud hiss can be heard as some of 
rock is burnt away by the acid, producing tiny pock marks. Nothing natural
could live here.

The solid rock floor is scarred by the continual drops of acid that drip 
from the roof above. It feels very hot through your boots and seems to
almost radiate death up at you. Your shadow seems to be missing.

black viscous liquid~
The liquid is of the purest black colour, and incredibly thick. It oozes 
very slowly through holes in the roof and drips to the ground, burning small
scars into the rock. It must be a very powerful acid.

The faces are all crowded together, no room between them. Their mouths
have been stitched together, preventing them from talking, but they stare at 
you with a terrified look, almost as if they are warning you not to go any 
further.

The Tunnel To Hell~
   Thousands of tortured faces are embedded in the rock walls, all crying
out to you, their features twisted into perpetual torment. The roof drips 
with a black viscous liquid which hisses as it hits the ground. Terrifying  
screams can be heard in the distance. The tunnel continues to the north and
south.

The wall is alive with a writhing mass of faces, the last remnants of poor
tortured souls. They seem to plead you for help in ending their eternal 
damnation. The vision is awful and grotesque.

The End Of The Tunnel To Hell~
   Thousands of tortured faces are embedded in the rock walls, all crying
out to you, their features twisted into perpetual torment. The roof drips 
with a black viscous liquid which hisses as it hits the ground. Terrifying  
screams can be heard from a chamber to the east. The tunnel continues back
to the west.

The tunnel ends at the entrance to a very large chamber. The odd gust of 
fire comes belching out at you accompanied by a terrified scream. The mad
sound of an evil laughter can be heard.

The Satanic Chamber~
   You have entered the throne room of one of the most feared creatures in
mortal legends. There is no colour here, just the darkness of death. Upon a
large pedestal in the centre of the chamber, a huge throne dominates, its
looming presence mocking your very being. The sound of screams is almost
deafening. How can a place be so hot but send such a shiver through you?

The walls are completely black, totally devoid of colour or any details
whatsoever. The light from your lantern is so completely absorbed by them
that you get a feeling of being lost inside a vast expanse with no ending.
This is a place of utter dread where all hopes are terminated and life has
no meaning.

A large archway has been carved in the wall, a strange point of lightness in
the otherwise black wall. You can leave this godforsaken place back into the
tunnel.

The black ceiling absorbs your light so completely that it is impossible to
tell how high the roof climbs above you. The blackness makes you feel weary
as if there is no point in carrying on, that all this is futile.

The ground is meticulously clean and the rock polished to a high finish.
Staring down at your refection in the mirror-like surface you see a haggard
and old image, a down and out, a loser. You feel depressed. A sudden gust of
fire snaps you out of this nightmare, making you feel just a little
uncomfortable.

pedestal~
The pedestal is circular and stands in the centre of the chamber. Having a
diameter of twenty feet, it stands at least five feet above the ground.
Steps have been carved into the front which lead up to the throne upon it.
Screaming faces of the soulless are trapped for eternity in it, encrusted
like gems in a piece of jewellery.

E
throne~
The throne stands proud upon the pedestal, overlooking the vast chamber from
a commanding position. It is gigantic, the seat being at least four feet
square. Made from solid gold and encrusted with diamonds and rubies the size
of a fist, it is in sharp contrast to the sparsity of the rest of the
chamber. It must weigh a few tonnes at least.
