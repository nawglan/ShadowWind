The Centaur Grove~
  A large oak grove that surrounds what was once a pleasant clearing with a
small brook winding through it. Now it resembles an armed encampment under
siege. Huge brush barriers with sharpened sticks thrust through them sur-
round the grove's outer perimeter, and spears, bows, bundles of arrows and
javelins have been set in strategic areas around the barrier where they 
can be snatched up easily and quickley by dedenders.

The Rocky Ledge Along The Sea~
  This downward sloping face of the ledge makes it difficult for any creature
to move around freely, the abundance of marine life as well as the occasional
sea birds make this area of the sea shore alive. There are tall greenish-
yellow sea grasses waiving in the breese, soft to the eye and pleasing to the
sences, this would seem to be a place to nap in the sun.
