The Tunnel Of Sticks~
   All around are sticks, sticks of all shapes and sizes, branches and
even live roots grow through here searching for moisture. This seems to
be a natural tunnel made of fallen wood, but it somehow seems unnatural,
unnerving, damp, very cold and bitterly evil.  Far above lies the forest
of MiNar in all its might.

The Tunnel Of Sticks~
   All around are sticks, sticks of all shapes and sizes, branches and
even live roots grow through here searching for moisture. This seems to
be a natural tunnel made of fallen wood, but it somehow seems unnatural,
unnerving, damp, very cold and bitterly evil.  Far above lies the forest
of MiNar in all its might.

The Tunnel Of Sticks~
   All around are sticks, sticks of all shapes and sizes, branches and
even live roots grow through here searching for moisture. This seems to
be a natural tunnel made of fallen wood, but it somehow seems unnatural,
unnerving, damp, very cold and bitterly evil.  Far above lies the forest
of MiNar in all its might.

The Tunnel Of Sticks~
   All around are sticks, sticks of all shapes and sizes, branches and
even live roots grow through here searching for moisture. This seems to
be a natural tunnel made of fallen wood, but it somehow seems unnatural,
unnerving, damp, very cold and bitterly evil.  Far above lies the forest
of MiNar in all its might.
