garru mapmaker~
Garru the Mapmaker~
Garru the Mapmaker is here, meticulously drawing another map.
~
Garru is a tall, thin man, who is well past his prime.  The wrinkles which
cover the majority of his face are like a map into his soul.  It is clear
that he spends the better part of each day drawing the meticulous maps that
he sells in the shop.  Although Garru looks to be well past his prime, his
knowledge of the surrounding world and his quick wit lead you to believe
that he's not just another old shopkeeper.
