any way.

devil she~
the She-Devil~
A rather beautiful Devil is grooming her forked tail.
~
Built to the same proportions as an average human female, this devil has an
almost exotic attractiveness to it. She twirls her tail at the men in your
party, who seem to have a definite interest in her. Temptation is a deadly
sin, and that is the only purpose that this poor creature was created for.

the Little Devil~
A little Devil runs about your feet, snarling viciously.
~
The little sprite is no more than three feet tall and as thin as a rake. It
has little horns on the top of its head and a pixie like face, which grins
up at you with a cheeky smile. A long tail swishes high into the air behind
it, brushing you as it moves around.

evil soul~
the Evil Soul~
An Evil Soul wanders through the tunnels, shrieking loudly.
~
The evil soul hovers above the ground. A dirty grey colour, you can see
almost totally through it. This is the remains of a poor soul that was sold
to the devil in a vain attempt to better oneself in the mortal life. Now, it
is destined to wander these tunnels for all eternity, until a good hearted
being ends its misery. It radiates evil.

the Protector of Hell~
A huge Devil protects the Mighty Satan.
~
Standing beside the Great Throne of Evil, this huge devil stands protector
and loyal servant of Satan. He stands at least ten feet tall, with a
monstrous head that has two great horns. A gigantic tail whips behind him, a
lethal weapon in itself. Completely red in colour, the creatures skin is
covered in numerous scars and blisters, the evidence of some severe torture
in the past. He will do anything his Master bids.

devil satan~
Satan~
Satan is relaxing here on his huge golden throne.
~
Satan, Lord of all Evil, one of the most feared beings in mortal legend is
even more frightening that you could imagine. A pale white colour, he is
immense in size. Large, bulbous, red veins streak his entire body. He is
shrouded in a black aura which can only be the souls he is torturing. It
hurts to look at him, he radiates so much evil and harm. His face is always
twisting in and out reality, in the most sickening way. His two hands have
six claws each, twelve lethal swords ready to slash your skin apart.
