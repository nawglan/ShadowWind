the Miner~
A Miner is busy working at the rock face.
~
The miner is over six feet tall with huge broad shoulders and muscles that
seem to be growing on top of other muscles. He is completely bare chested
and sweating from his arduous work. In his large, calloused hands he holds a
shiny pick to hack with at the rock face.

horn sticks out from the centre of his head, its blunted tip still lethal in
combat. Without taking much notice of you, he continues to read the day's

A small child sits here playing with her sister.
~
The child is a small elf, no more than four years old. She sits on the floor
playing with her twin sister, drawing pictures and telling stories. At this
age, nothing could possibly scare her, the world is too unreal. She 
occasionally looks up at her mother, the close bond between them evident.

the old woman~
An old woman is asleep in her bed, snoring loudly.
~
The woman is a very old elf, at least past her hundredth year. Her face is
etched deeply with lines by the passage of time, but she looks very peaceful
and innocent in her slumber. Her snoring is very loud, completely at odds to
her frail looking frame. It will not be many years before she passes away
after a long and probably fruitful life.

has never since been discovered, a most fearsome power.
