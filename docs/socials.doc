                  CircleMUD Socials Modified for Shadowwind
                  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The file is formatted as follows:

--------------------------------------------
<command name> <hide-flag> <minimum position of victim>
<messg to character if no argument>
<messg to others if no argument>
<messg to char if victim found>           <---If this field is empty,
<messg to others if victim found>     <-------\ 
<messg to victim>                     <-------|\  then these fields must be
<messg to char if victim not found>   <-------| | skipped, and the action
<messg to char if vict is char>       <-------|/  will ignore arguments.
<messg to others if vict is char>     <-------/

-Leave one space between each social-

$~ <--- This must be at the very end of the file, last line.
-------------------------------------------------

Command Name
=----------=

    This field is nothing more than the name of the social.
    ie: smile, bounce, grin, etc...

Hide-Flag
=-------=
    
    This field defines if the one making the action if hidden or not, in
    most all cases this should be 0.

    0 - This means the one preforming the action may be seen by all in
        the current room.

    1 - This means that only the one preforming the action and the victim
        the action is preformed upon may see it.
        NOTE: This should be used only in extream cases.

    Each social must contain one or the other of these hide flags.

Minimum Position of Victim
=------------------------=

   This defines the victim's position as used in socials.
      A position is one of:

         POSITION_DEAD       0  DO NOT USE
         POSITION_MORTALLYW  1  DO NOT USE
         POSITION_INCAP      2  DO NOT USE
         POSITION_STUNNED    3  DO NOT USE
         POSITION_SLEEPING   4  The victim is sleeping.
         POSITION_RESTING    5  The victim is resting.
         POSITION_SITTING    6  The victim is sitting.
         POSITION_FIGHTING   7  DO NOT USE.
         POSITION_STANDING   8  The victim is standing.

  If the social you are making is ment to work _ONLY_ on a victim that is
  standing, the minimum position should be 8, however, if the social should
  work on a victim of all avaliable positions it should be 5.

  Socials such as 'giggle' that are not requireing a victim may use
  position 0, the reason behind this is simple, there is no victim
  so the position doesnt matter. :)

Various requirements of each Social
=---------------------------------=

  Each social must contain either:

  1) only the first two messages (if the social ignores arguments)

  -or-

  2) all eight messages (if the social takes an argument).

  Each message must be contained in one line.

In case 1 above, you must add a # on the 3rd line in the social so the code
will know the social is only 2 lines.
