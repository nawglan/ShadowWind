What the above example shows us:
The mob with the vnum of 3143 is assigned to this quest.  The goal of the
quest is 20000 experience points.  Only players level 13 or less can
participate in this quest.  Multiple players can work on the quest,
though the one that provides the final piece to the puzzle will be the one
rewarded.  In this case there is only one needs section, so this doesn't
really matter much. The needs sections must be solved in order, because there
is only 1 this has no significance. This quest can only be completed once per
player.  All classes can participate. There are 3 keywords sections, each
with a corresponding message.  The last one has 2 keywords which will allow
the message to be triggered by the phrase "hiding place", or the word hiding
or the word place.
